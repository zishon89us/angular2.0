# TypeScript

- TypeScript provide an optional type system for JavaScript because types have proven ability to enhance code quality and understandability.
- Types increase your agility when doing refactoring. Its better for the compiler to catch errors than to have things fail at runtime.
- TypeScript provide planned features from future JavaScript editions to current JavaScript engines.
- TypeScript provides compile time type safety for your JavaScript code.
- TypeScript is intentionally and strictly a superset of JavaScript with optional Type checking.
   
Happy Coding!
