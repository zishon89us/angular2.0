# TypeScript

- TypeScript provide an optional type system for JavaScript because types have proven ability to enhance code quality and understandability.
- Types increase your agility when doing refactoring. Its better for the compiler to catch errors than to have things fail at runtime.
- TypeScript provide planned features from future JavaScript editions to current JavaScript engines.
- TypeScript provides compile time type safety for your JavaScript code.
- TypeScript is intentionally and strictly a superset of JavaScript with optional Type checking.
- TypeScript tries to infer as much of the type information as it can in order to give you type safety with minimal cost of productivity during code development.
- TypeScript uses postfix type annotations popular in other optionally annotated languages (e.g. ActionScript and F#).
- To make it easy for you to migrate your JavaScript code to TypeScript, even if there are compilation errors, by default TypeScript will emit valid JavaScript the best that it can.
- One of the main selling points of TypeScript is that it allows you to use a bunch of features from ES6 and beyond in current (ES3 and ES5 level) JavaScript engines (like current browsers and NodeJS).
   
Happy Coding!
